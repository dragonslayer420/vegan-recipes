> Recipes I made in [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com)

I exclude all foods that are not healthy to me and experiment with recipes from the [many foods](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/health/nutrition/foods.html) that are healthy. I follow a mostly whole foods pesceterian diet.

You can clone this repository to easily download the recipes to Paprika app.
